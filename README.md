# Python-Linear-Regression-to-Predict-Housing-Price
# Housing Data of King County, USA contains eighteen variables including the price, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, grade, floors, etc. 
# The data sets were analyzed using Linear Regression model in Python with the aim of predicting the price of a house in King County USA. 
# The target variable is the price, the grade variable shows the highest accuracy of 45%, followed by sqft_above at 37% also with the Price
# Linear Regression model is then deployed to analyse the dataset in 3D and predict house price in King County USA. 
# Grade is plotted in y-axis while the sqft_above is plotted on the z-axis to produce a 3D visual plot for a better interpretation.
# As an independent variable, Grade is fitted into 0 to 40 on the y-axis, sqft_above is on the z-axis fitted into 0 to 8
# while the Price dataset as a target variable is fitted into 0 to 16 on the x-axis. 
# The dataset is splitted into (a) Train set: 2/3 of the data to train the model. (b) Test set: 1/3 of the data to test the model.
# Linear regression model plot shows that the number of houses increases relative to decline in prices and smallest sqft_above values
# The following evaluation parameters were produced from the plots: Coefficients: [1.51435849e+05 1.00069987e+02], 
# Intercept: -797887.9388761766, Prediction: [201314.72836959], Mean squared error: 76527232430.7038, Coefficient of determination: 47%. 
# Therefore, the prediction value of house prices in King County is 201314.72836959 with 47% accuracy.
